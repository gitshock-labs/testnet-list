# Testnet Validator Channel
All Source Repository Testnet Eligible Node Validator Gitshock Finance &amp; Cosmos Network (Coming Soon)
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to participate as a validator on the testnet of the Ethereum and Cosmos networks. Before we get started, it's important to note that participating as a validator requires technical expertise, a good understanding of blockchain technology, and the ability to maintain server infrastructure. 

### Prerequisites
The recommended and officially supported operating system to host Gitshock Finance Nodes is Ubuntu 20.04 on a x86_64 compatible hardware. Although you can use Apple macOS or Microsoft Windows and other Nix flavors as well if you compile the node from the code code, currently only the official distribution can connect to the Gitshock Finance network.

1. A machine running a recent version of Ubuntu or another Linux distribution.
2. At least CPU 4 Core (2.1 Ghz or Above) 4GB of RAM (Recomended 8-16GB) and 250GB - 500GB of disk space.
3. Knowledge of execution layer of ethereum and consensus layer for eth2 beacon command line.
4. Basic understanding of Ethereum, including the difference between PoW and PoS consensus algorithms.

### Data Availability : 
1. Full Node : This node stores all the data but does not connect to Consensus. 
2. Light Node : Light clients conduct data availability sampling on the Data Availability network. 
3. Consensus Full Node : A Full Node to sync blockchain history.
